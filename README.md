## Mission

Assist at tracing where `Sars-CoV-2` could be by connecting people to doctors.

## Why?

The biggest challenge to contain the spread of the virus is to know where it
currently is. That could be done through testing, but I've seen most countries
struggling to supply such important thing.  
Current official numbers reflects a situation of days or even weeks ago, many
lives could be saved if we know at least where the most commom symptoms is
showing right now, or by having those people guided by professionals to get
treated or tested while the population awaits for federal gov to setup physical
test spots.

## How?

A mobile webapp showing a map with the approximate location of the reportings
and their current state with privacy in mind to both parties.  
People will be able to enter their symptoms with their mobile phone number.
The person will receive a code through SMS in order to help validate the
information.  
Doctors can see the phone numbers and call them to decide if those people
need to be tested or not, guide the pacients or report the cases to competent
organizations to take action.  
Each new report can have five states:

    - Waiting contact (initial state)
    - Test pending (decided by the doctor)
    - Positive (Infected)
    - Negative (Not infected)
    - Discarded (Discarded by the doctor through the call or visit).

Doctors will need to register to be able to change the record's state.

## When?

Time is our enemy(along with the virus), we need to act now otherwise or the
damage will be unrecoverable. April 3 is my goal to have this working.  
Any type of help is welcome.

## Goals

1. Find more people to help the project achieve it's mission.
2. Make this service known to regular people.
3. Reach doctors to contribute with calls to pacients.

## Mantra-like videos to remember why we do this:
